<p>According to our best guess and calculation, the baby&#8217;s conception date was approximately:</p>

<h2 id="saturday-december-20-1902">Saturday December 20, 1902</h2>

<h4 id="how-do-you-calculate-my-conception-date">How do you calculate my conception date?</h4>

<ul>
  <li>The estimated dates are use an average menstrual cycle (28 days).</li>
  <li>The estimated date use an average gestation period of 38 weeks to calculate the conception date.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to note, that sperm can live for 3-5 days in a woman&#8217;s body (under right conditions - at least that&#8217;s what Wikipedia tells me), so this would mean you or your parents likely had sexual intercourse sometime between:</p>

<p><strong>Monday December 15, 1902</strong> and <strong>Saturday December 20, 1902</strong></p>

<p><strong>Very Important:</strong> My expertise is in SEO and Excel, not OBGYN. I got tired of Googling &#8220;When did we conceive&#8221; every time my wife got pregnant. <em>This is not medical advice or an expert opinion.
